intro: Tomorrow is another day, and we want to make it <strong>brighter</strong>! We depend almost entirely on sponsors from outside of the university, who help us afford the costs of building, racing, and maintaining our cars. If you think you would like to support our team, please <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1428/gid2/index.aspx?sid=1428&gid=2&pgid=418&cid=1173&bledit=1&dids=158" target="_blank">make a donation</a>.

<h2>How Does Your Donation Help?</h2>
<p>Donations help cover the costs of team operations, from building a car to racing and maintaining it. Traveling to and participating in a race costs upwards of $5,000, which is a small amount compared to the $200,000 (at least) required to build a new car. All donations go towards these, and other functions of the team.</p>

<h2>Sponsorship Tiers</h2>
<p>As a donor, your donation will qualify you to be placed into one of the following tiers. Each tier receives a different amount of recognition, from their logo on our car to a shoutout on social media.</p>
