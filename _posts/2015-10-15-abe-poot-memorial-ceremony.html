The ceremony will begin at 10:00 am outside of Heritage Hall on Prospect Hill. (<a href="http://www.wmich.edu/maps/?bldg=001" target="_blank">Directions to Heritage Hall</a>)</p>

<p>During the ceremony, Abeâ€™s family will be presented with a signed photo of the 2012 ASC Sunseeker Solar Car Project race team, and the ASC Solar Car Lifetime Achievement Award the team accepted on his behalf following the 2014 American Solar Challenge.</p>

<p>We ask that if you know of anyone who had worked with Abe, please pass this information along to them. We would like to have as many people present as possible.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
