        <h2>Sunseeker 1995</h2>
        <p>Originally built in 1990, and modified/reused many times in its history, the 1995 car is the longest lasting solar car produced by the team. It still exists today, and can usually be seen on display at the <a href="http://www.airzoo.org" target="_blank">Air Zoo</a> in Portage, Michigan, near Kalamazoo. (Except for a couple months of the year when the team uses it for special events.)</p>
