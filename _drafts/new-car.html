excerpt: After a five-year run with the previous solar car, the team is returning to the American Solar Challenge with an entirely new vehicle in 2016!
---

<p>We recently announced our intention to compete in the 2016 American Solar Challenge and Formula Sun Grand Prix, however we never said which vehicle we'd be taking. For the last five years, the <a href="{{ "/our-cars/2010" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2010 car</a> has been our primary vehicle, or in other words, the one we race. It has performed well in its time, but we feel a new vehicle is in order.</p>

<p>Sunseeker 2016 will be the culmination of a few year's work done by the team. One of the primary goals behind the design of the car is to meet the regulations of the World Solar Challenge, so that this car may one day compete in such an event. We've also considered new regulations of the American Solar Challenge.</p>

<p>Some of the differences between the the 2016 car and the retired 2010 car will include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Four-wheel layout</li>
    <li>Rear-wheel drive</li>
    <li>Carbon fiber body</li>
    <li>Lithium ion batteries</li>
    <li>Custom designed and manufactured rims</li>
    <li>Shorter in height and length, also wider</li>
    <li>Lighter weight</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you're as excited about this new car as we are, we will keep everyone up to date via our blog and social media as we progress through the build!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading,<br>Alec</p>
