<p>We recently announced our intention to compete in the 2016 American Solar Challenge and Formula Sun Grand Prix, however we never said which vehicle we'd be taking. For the last five years, the <a href="{{ "/our-cars/2010" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2010 car</a> has been our primary vehicle, or in other words, the one we race. Considering its shortcomings, the vehicle has performed well, but we feel a replacement is long overdue.</p>
